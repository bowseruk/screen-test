The world's BEST movie quiz


# Project description: 
A movie themed quiz. The quiz will randomly generate a quiz question based on: 

* guess the year
* name the movie title
* name the actor

The user then will be given clues in the form of either: 

* movie poster
* movie name
* themed gif
* plot
* actors in movie

Possibly add later - have lifelines that they can use to give better clues (give image, 50/50 etc.)
