# Screen Test
The world's BEST movie quiz


## Description
A movie themed interactive quiz where users have to guess the movie title based on three hints: 
* the year it was released
* a gif of one of the actors
* the plot

## Motivation
We decided to create this project because we all share a love for movies and wanted to produce an application which users could enjoy interacting with.

## Challenges & Successes
Challenges: 
* Learning a new technique. Rather than duplicate functions between script files, we used Class’s to split everything into script files with specific functions (view, modal and controller). This was new for most of us, but was exciting to learn a new way of working.
* Making dynamic favicons and animating curtains

Successes: 
* Coding together really helped us to develop the website and generate new ideas whilst we were working, that perhaps we wouldn’t have come up with working individually. We all found this way of working very enjoyable as we’d all work together to solve problems!
* Using Git branches successfully as a team without any conflicts
* We made it mobile-friendly

## User Story
* AS A movie 101 lover
* I WANT to test my movie knowledge to see how if I'm a movie master or movie loser
* SO THAT I can brag to the rest of the class
